## Challenge
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to see correlation to outcome a) based on goal b)based on launch date of  campaign 
#### a)Based on Goal (Plays)
Observation 
---
1. Successful campaigns > Failed Campaigns for Goal < $15000. It is important to be realistic when setting goals.
2. > 70% campaign successful for goal < $10000
3. > 90% of campaign goal is < $15000. If a goal is >  $15000, it must have very good reasons.
#### b)Based On Launch Date (Theater)
Observation
1. The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. 
2. On the other hand, December  doesnâ€™t seem like a great time to launch a campaign. 
3. Cancellations are only a few through the years. So Majority in the Theater category does get launched
4. With the theater category, there is a better chance of success than failure, as Success > Failure for all months. Overall, success is about 60% (839/1393)

Limitation
1. Perhaps we should sort it by geographic location and season (winter) to see trends better. As most countries are in Northern Hemisphere (Data needed OR  to be generated based on country), the data is skewed towards Dec. It may be, winter is a factor for the outcome/activity
2. The spread in number of campaigns by month in a year is rather large. To understand this better drill down by country/city etc.
