### Challenge
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to see correlation to outcome based on launch date of campaign 
---
1. The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. 
---
2. On the other hand, December  doesnâ€™t seem like a great time to launch a campaign. 
---
3. Cancellations are only a few through the years. So Majority in the Theater category does get launched

4. With the theater category, there is a better chance of success than failure, as success > Failure for all months. Overall, success is > 60%

Limitation
1. Probaly sort it by geographic location and season (winter) to see trends better. As most countries are in Northern Hemisphere, the data is skewed towards Dec. It may be, winter is a factor for the outcome/activity
2.
